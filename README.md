# Hello, I'm FreedYool 👋  

I'm a **Software Engineer 💻 specializing in Low-Power Embedded System Development & Verification**, currently working at a semiconductor design company. My core responsibilities include:  

*   **🔧 Low-Power Module Development:** Designing and implementing chip power management features.  
*   **🚧 Chip Verification:** Ensuring low-power designs meet specifications.  
*   **📦 SDK Development:** Supporting chip software development toolkits.  

In my daily work, I leverage **C** and **Python 🐍**, with deep expertise in **embedded systems, driver development**, and hardware-centric **low-power verification workflows**.  

Concurrently, I'm pursuing a part-time **Master's degree 🎓 in Electronic Information (Microelectronics concentration)** at the **School of Communication and Electronic Engineering, East China Normal University** (Year 3). My thesis focuses on **IoT Low-Power Debugging**, developing an integrated system combining **current data acquisition 🔋, logic analysis 📊, and network packet capture 🌐**.  

**✨ Tech Exploration is My Passion!** Beyond my core field, I actively expand my skillset:  
*   **🚀 Frontend/Full-Stack Experience:** Led undergrad teams to launch two WeChat Mini Programs (WheatEar Resume, WheatFun Assessment).  
*   **⚡ Efficiency Tool Creation:** Independently developed and maintain a **Tampermonkey script** boosting code review/verification efficiency on **Gerrit**.  
*   **🌐 Open Source Contribution:** Recently contributed new features to the **Nordic/pc-nrfconnect-ppk** (React+Electron+Embedded) open-source project.  

I firmly believe **🤖 AI-powered tools are dramatically amplifying individual developer capabilities**, shrinking product development cycles (from design to release) from months to weeks. I sense the dawn of a **golden age for indie developers 🚀** – and I'm actively **running, exploring, and creating 💪 on this path.**  

**Looking forward to connecting & exploring the future together!** 🌱
